# kmallclean
Use machine learning to clean a point cloud inside a kmall file and write out a new kmall file which has ALL the original data but with the rejected soundings flagged as rejected.  the file can then be imported into caris / qimera for further processing.  the rejected beams can always be re-accepted in the post processing package
